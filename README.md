# Rubiks
Simple Rubik's cube implementation 


I have three parts in mind for this project:

1.  Create an api for the digital cube.  This includes making turns and scambling the cube.

2.  Write an alogorithm to solve the cube.  The first iteration of this will be using f2l and the easy methods for solving the last layer.

3.  Try to use machine learning to make the computer find it's own solutions
